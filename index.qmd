# NAture-positive SCenarios for ENvironmental Transitions: Peru

The NASCENT-PERU project is centered around developing [normative](glossary.qmd#NScenarios), nature positive [scenarios](glossary.qmd#NScenarios) for future landscape development in Peru and assessing their impacts on [land use and land cover (LULC)](glossary.qmd#LULC), [biodiversity](glossary.qmd#Biodiversity), and [ecosystem services](glossary.qmd#ES) (BES) from 2020 to 2060. The [scenarios](glossary.qmd#Scenarios) will be developed through an inclusive participatory process with a cross-section of Peruvian stakeholders, employing the IPBES [Nature Futures Framework (NFF)](glossary.qmd#NFF) to encourage a shift beyond typical exploratory trends such as ‘Business as Usual’ to envisage future landscapes that meet the needs of society, support cultural values and preserve nature. Building upon the approach of the <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/593508/iEMSs_ValPar_pres.pdf?sequence=4" target="_blank">ValPar.CH</a> project, quantitative simulation modelling along with economic analysis will be leveraged to identify trade-offs and synergies in BES outcomes, to inform an ongoing dialogue regarding the desirability and feasibility of the different scenario goals.
