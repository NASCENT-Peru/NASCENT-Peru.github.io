The scenarios will be developed through an inclusive participatory process with a cross-section of Peruvian stakeholders, employing the IPBES Nature Futures Framework (NFF) to encourage a shift beyond typical exploratory trends such as ‘Business as Usual’ to envisage future landscapes that meet the needs of society, support cultural values and preserve nature. Building upon the approach of the ValPar.CH project, quantitative simulation modelling along with economic analysis will be leveraged to identify trade-offs and synergies in BES outcomes, to inform an ongoing dialogue regarding the desirability and feasibility of the different scenario goals."

In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem services can be divided into supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural. This classification, however, is superseded in IPBES assessments by the system used under “Nature’s contributions to people”. This is because IPBES recognizes that many services fit into more than one of the four categories. For example, food is both a provisioning service and also, emphatically, a cultural service, in many cultures.\n\nSource: IPBES core glossary, 2021\n\n\n\nLand Use Land Cover (LULC)\n\n\n\nLand Use\n\nThe human use of a specific area for a certain purpose (such as residential, agriculture, recreation, industrial, etc.). Influenced by, but not synonymous with, land cover. Land-use change refers to a change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover.\n\n\nLand Cover\n\nThe physical coverage of land, usually expressed in terms\nof vegetation cover or lack of it.

Beneficial contributions from nature include such things as food provision, water purification, flood control, and artistic inspiration, whereas detrimental contributions include disease transmission and predation that damages people or their assets. Many NCP may be perceived as benefits or detriments depending on the cultural, temporal or spatial context.\n\nSource: Pörtner et al., 2021\n\n\n\nNature Futures Framework (NFF)\n\n\n\nA heuristic that captures diverse, positive values of human-nature relationships along three types of specific value perspectives on nature: intrinsic (also known as ‘nature for nature’), instrumental (‘nature for society’), and relational (‘nature as culture/one with nature’) values. These values of nature are not mutually exclusive and intricately intertwined by nature. In the context of Western science, these positive values can be located in a triangular space whose tips represent the three types of value perspectives on nature.\n\nSource: IPBES, 2023\n\n\n\nNormative Scenarios\n\n\n\nTarget-seeking scenarios (also known as “goal-seeking scenarios” or “normative scenarios”) are scenarios that start with the definition of a clear objective, or a set of objectives, specified either in terms of achievable targets, or as an objective function to be optimized, and then identify different pathways to achieving this outcome (e.g. through backcasting).\n\nSource: IPBES core glossary, 2021\n\n\n\nScenarios\n\n\n\nRepresentations of possible futures for one or more components of a system, particularly for drivers of change in nature and nature’s benefits, including alternative policy or management options.\n\nSource: IPBES, 2018"

However it was interesting to see that some characteristics, especially actions to promote positive change were similar.\nWe had planned to use several whiteboards to collect all the inputs for the 3 Horizons but we quickly realised that we had so many suggestions that we had to resort to use the wall and parts of the windows instead! This is testament to the energy and enthusiasm from our brilliant participants and we would like to thank them all again for their time.\nThis workshop could not have happened without the support from our partner organisation the Wyss Academy for Natures’ South American Hub, who kindly hosted us at their office. We would especially like to thank Liselot Lange, Alejandro Portillo and Armando Valdés-Velásquez for all their help with the organisation.\nToday we travel to the Ancash region to prepare for the next workshop in Huaraz on June 4th.\nHere are some photos from the workshop and below you can access the presentation that was shown."

In attendance were a selection of stakeholders from the regional government, NGOs and community organisations, local businesses and academia.\nHere the focus of the workshop was on exploring what would be desirable characteristics for the landscape of coastal Northern Peru in 2060. To frame this discussion we adapted the future visioning approach, proposed by Bill Sharpe, the 3 horizons Framework.\n\n\n\nNASCENT-Peru adaptation of the 3 Horizons Framework\n\n\nFirst participants were asked to create a characterization of the current landscape in their region under 3 themes: Landscape features, contributions and values. Then they did the same for the landscape they would like to see in 2060. Finally to bridge the gap we asked them to discuss which of the drivers of landscape change from our national workshop will either help or hinder reaching the desired future as well as other important actions needed. Look out for a post sharing some detailed insights into the results soon.\nWe would like to thank the UDEP for kindly allowing us to host the workshop on their campus and especially Raúl Eduardo Olivares, Edsmilda Martinez Hidalgo and Daniela Zavala for their assistance in the organisation. Of course, the workshop could not have happened without our fantastic participants, so we would like to thank you all again for your time and energy.

This was a special opportunity for us to be able to engage with students and to spread the word about the importance of nature positive visions for the future.\nIn this regard the participants in our workshop provided some insightful and thought-provoking ideas for their visions of a sustainable future landscape. A prominent example was the need to expand publicly accessible recreation spaces for fostering a positive relationship with nature in the next generation. We would like to once again thank everyone who generously contributed with their time and expertise!\nNow that we have gathered perspectives from four different regions in Peru the next step will be to bring all of these ideas together into different scenario narratives of future landscape development.

Situated in the Callejón de Huaylas valley at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, we choose Huaraz in order to bring a perspective on what might be desirable future changes in mountainous landscapes in Peru.\nPrior to the workshop, we explored the region for several days and saw first-hand the extent to which the Glaciers are already disappearing. At the same time we also saw some inspiring examples of how agricultural producers can take advantage of climatic conditions in the mountain valleys to produce an expansive range of crops.\nAs you can see from the photo below we had a full house with participants of different ages and backgrounds, from students and farmers, to mountain guides and members of the regional government. As in the other regional workshops, we used the 3 horizons frameworks to guide participants in thinking from the present landscape into the future and at the end of the session we received some thought-provoking inputs. Particularly that the workshop had been a good format to bring different actors together and that it was important to establish a means of communication for participants to continue the dialogue around driving positive change in the region in the future.\nOur last workshop of 2024 will be held in Tarapoto in the San Martín region on June 11th.\nHere are some photos from the workshop and below you can access the presentation that was shown."

    "text": "In May and June 2024 we undertook a series of 5 workshops in Peru. In these workshops we discussed the current state and future development of landscapes with participants from various backgrounds. In the first part of each workshop, participants were asked to characterize the current landscape in their region from their perspective. Following this, participants discussed and presented characteristics of what would be, in their opinion, a desirable future landscape for their region in the year 2060. Finally, participants identified the drivers (i.e. forces and processes of change) that would either facilitate or hinder the transition from the current landscape to their desired future landscape.\nFollowing the workshops, we have collated all the distinct contributions regarding characteristics of the future landscape as seperate statements and our next step is to organise these into groups. These groups of statements will then form the basis of the future scenario narratives we will develop.\nTo group the statements, we are utilising the Nature Futures Framework (NFF) developed by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The Nature Futures Framework captures diverse values of human-nature relationships according to three different perspectives, which are represented as different axes in a triangular arrangement: Intrinsic values (‘nature for nature’), instrumental values (‘nature for society’), and relational values (‘nature as culture/one with nature’).\n\n\n\nNature Futures Framework\n\n\nImportantly, the statements describing characteristics of the desired future landscapes do not have to be aligned to a single value perspective (axis of the NFF), and they may actually represent multiple values. For example, the statement ‘a shift towards sustainable tourism’ can be perceived to show a respect for, and hence intrinsic valuing of, the natural landscape but also a valuing of the benefits that the landscape has for society, in this the potential for tourism as an economic activity. Of course, the perception of these values is subjective and this is why we would like to have different perspectives from a number of people regarding placing the statements within the NFF.\nTo facilitate this, we have created a survey, in the form of an interactive app. The app will present you with 60 distinct statements regarding characteristics of a desirable future landscape in Peru in 2060 and you will be able to place a point for each statement within the triangular space of the NFF representing your opinion on how the statements reflects the three value perspectives. The video below shows how the app works:\n\n\n\nSome important points:\n\nThe statements are available in both Spanish and English and some have accompanying explanations where technical terms are used.\nSome statements may sound very similar to others, but they have deliberately been included as they capture a slightly different idea/concept.\nAfter statements have been placed inside the NFF you can hover over the point with your mouse to display the statement, this maybe useful when placing related statements.\nThis exercise should take approximately X minutes to complete\nAfter all statements have been placed within the NFF there is a button to submit your answers which will be added directly to confidential google sheet.\n\nWe very much value the time and contributions of all participants and as such we would include your names in a list of contributors to the project on both the project website and in all reports produced. If you do not wish for your name to be included in this list there is an option to specify this within the app.\n\nClick here to start the survey"

A short presentation of the project was followed by lively discussions on the identification of drivers that will define the future landscapes in Peru. Keep an eye on our website where we will share a detailed summary of the outputs soon.\nWe would like to thank the International Potato Center (CIP) and the Wyss Academy for Nature for their hospitality and all participants for their interesting inputs. We are excited for the four upcoming regional workshops, where we will define diverse visions for desirable future landscapes.\nHere are some photos from the day and below you can see the presentation that was shown. Look out for a post sharing some insights into the results soon!"
