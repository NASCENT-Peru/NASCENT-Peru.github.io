    "text": "In May and June 2024 we undertook a series of 5 workshops in Peru. In these workshops we discussed the current state and future development of landscapes with participants from various backgrounds. In the first part of each workshop, participants were asked to characterize the current landscape in their region from their perspective. Following this, participants discussed and presented characteristics of what would be, in their opinion, a desirable future landscape for their region in the year 2060. Finally, participants identified the drivers (i.e. forces and processes of change) that would either facilitate or hinder the transition from the current landscape to their desired future landscape.\nFollowing the workshops, we have collated all the distinct contributions regarding characteristics of the future landscape as seperate statements and our next step is to organise these into groups. These groups of statements will then form the basis of the future scenario narratives we will develop.\nTo group the statements, we are utilising the Nature Futures Framework (NFF) developed by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The Nature Futures Framework captures diverse values of human-nature relationships according to three different perspectives, which are represented as different axes in a triangular arrangement: Intrinsic values (‘nature for nature’), instrumental values (‘nature for society’), and relational values (‘nature as culture/one with nature’).\n\n\n\nNature Futures Framework\n\n\nImportantly, the statements describing characteristics of the desired future landscapes do not have to be aligned to a single value perspective (axis of the NFF), and they may actually represent multiple values. For example, the statement ‘a shift towards sustainable tourism’ can be perceived to show a respect for, and hence intrinsic valuing of, the natural landscape but also a valuing of the benefits that the landscape has for society, in this the potential for tourism as an economic activity. Of course, the perception of these values is subjective and this is why we would like to have different perspectives from a number of people regarding placing the statements within the NFF.\nTo facilitate this, we have created a survey, in the form of an interactive app. The app will present you with 60 distinct statements regarding characteristics of a desirable future landscape in Peru in 2060 and you will be able to place a point for each statement within the triangular space of the NFF representing your opinion on how the statements reflects the three value perspectives. The video below shows how the app works:\n\n\n\nSome important points:\n\nThe statements are available in both Spanish and English and some have accompanying explanations where technical terms are used.\nSome statements may sound very similar to others, but they have deliberately been included as they capture a slightly different idea/concept.\nAfter statements have been placed inside the NFF you can hover over the point with your mouse to display the statement, this maybe useful when placing related statements.\nThis exercise should take approximately X minutes to complete\nAfter all statements have been placed within the NFF there is a button to submit your answers which will be added directly to confidential google sheet.\n\nWe very much value the time and contributions of all participants and as such we would include your names in a list of contributors to the project on both the project website and in all reports produced. If you do not wish for your name to be included in this list there is an option to specify this within the app.\n\nClick here to start the survey"

This was a special opportunity for us to be able to engage with students and to spread the word about the importance of nature positive visions for the future.\nIn this regard the participants in our workshop provided some insightful and thought-provoking ideas for their visions of a sustainable future landscape. A prominent example was the need to expand publicly accessible recreation spaces for fostering a positive relationship with nature in the next generation. We would like to once again thank everyone who generously contributed with their time and expertise!\nNow that we have gathered perspectives from four different regions in Peru the next step will be to bring all of these ideas together into different scenario narratives of future landscape development. This will take some time, however, we will share some first results from the national and regional workshops through our website and social media channels in the coming weeks!"

In attendance were a selection of stakeholders from the regional government, NGOs and community organisations, local businesses and academia.\nHere the focus of the workshop was on exploring what would be desirable characteristics for the landscape of coastal Northern Peru in 2060. To frame this discussion we adapted the future visioning approach, proposed by Bill Sharpe, the 3 horizons Framework.\n\n\n\nNASCENT-Peru adaptation of the 3 Horizons Framework\n\n\nFirst participants were asked to create a characterization of the current landscape in their region under 3 themes: Landscape features, contributions and values. Then they did the same for the landscape they would like to see in 2060. Finally to bridge the gap we asked them to discuss which of the drivers of landscape change from our national workshop will either help or hinder reaching the desired future as well as other important actions needed. Look out for a post sharing some detailed insights into the results soon.\nWe would like to thank the UDEP for kindly allowing us to host the workshop on their campus and especially Raúl Eduardo Olivares, Edsmilda Martinez Hidalgo and Daniela Zavala for their assistance in the organisation. Of course, the workshop could not have happened without our fantastic participants, so we would like to thank you all again for your time and energy.

The scenarios will be developed through an inclusive participatory process with a cross-section of Peruvian stakeholders, employing the IPBES Nature Futures Framework (NFF) to encourage a shift beyond typical exploratory trends such as ‘Business as Usual’ to envisage future landscapes that meet the needs of society, support cultural values and preserve nature. Building upon the approach of the ValPar.CH project, quantitative simulation modelling along with economic analysis will be leveraged to identify trade-offs and synergies in BES outcomes, to inform an ongoing dialogue regarding the desirability and feasibility of the different scenario goals."

    "text": "Business as Usual\n\nThe landscape of Peru in 2060 is emblematic of the drive for economic development at the expense of improving environmental sustainability. Agriculture and extractive activities have expanded to dominate large parts of the country exacerbating undesirable land use trends of deforestation and urban sprawl. The impacts of climatic change in terms of water and food security drive migration of the population from the mountainous regions to the coastal and amazonian areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\n  Climate Change:  RCP 4.5  \n\n\n  Population:  39.81 million by 2060 \n\n\n  Economic development:  1007 billion USD \n\n\n  Value perspective on nature:  Instrumental \n\n\n  Protected areas (proportion of Peru under protection):  25% by 2030 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting Values and Lifestyles\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and political instability in the late 2010’s Peru continues to prioritise economic development over addressing climate change and environmental degradation. Nature continues to be primarily viewed as a resource for economic growth, with little regard for its intrinsic value or its role in providing regulating and supporting ecosystem services necessary for maintaining quality of life (1).\nWhile economic development has helped to alleviate some social and economic inequalities, conservative social policies still leave significant gaps in access to basic services and education. By 2060 GDP per capita reaches approximately 1007 billion USD (following SSP2, unit converted to USD using purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2017; (2)), reflecting robust yet uneven economic progress. Consequently, environmental awareness and responsibility is still of limited concern for the majority of the population. Due to improvements in standards of living, the population continues to grow at a moderate rate reaching 39.81 million by 2060. This combined with a relatively high per capita living space and a moderate rate of rural to urban migration (86.88% of population living in urban areas by 2060), means that the total area of land utilized for human settlements expands considerably. Given that sustainability is not a strong focus and food security has been improved for the majority of the population, there is no large-scale shift in personal consumption habits, leading to an increase in average per capita meat consumption. In addition, unsustainable modes of private transport continue to dominate.\n\n\nChanging economic priorities\nEconomic development continues according to the current model of extractivism, maintaining reliance on resource and emission intensive activities (3). However, increasing political stability throughout the 2030s leads to greater foreign investment. This allows companies to steadily expand their international production networks, refining supply chains, diversifying operations, and tapping into global resources. This incremental growth leverages established trade agreements and gradual policy improvements to enhance efficiency and profitability, maintaining competitiveness without dramatic shifts from current practices1. These developments reduce the extent of the informal economy although Lima-Callao continues to be the only national metropolis and centre of service-based economic activities.\n1 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o21_2024Across the primary sectors, there is moderate adoption of new technologies, although these are focused on improving production and not necessarily sustainability (4). This process occurs asymmetrically, with larger businesses displaying much more success in technological adoption whereas small and medium sized enterprises are limited by a lack of capacity.\nIn agriculture, the broad transition from subsistence to commercial farming continues driven by demand for the export market. This results in an increase in agricultural intensification and the cultivation of non-native crops such as strawberries, asparagus and blueberries. There is also a greater amount of land utilised for livestock production to sustain the demand for meat products. As a result, the area of land utilized for agriculture expands significantly, coupled with a higher degree of intensification. This is accompanied by a shift from artisanal to industrial fishing and the expansion of aquaculture.\nRising international mineral prices, particularly for copper, drive continued expansion of mining activities. This results in the allocation of additional mining concessions, with minimal attention to sustainability improvements in the sector. Weak enforcement of regulations, coupled with lax environmental legislation, leads to high rates of concession exploitation, while small-scale illegal mining remains persistent. The current carbon-intensive model of mass tourism is maintained (5). It prioritises conventional attractions, contributing to over-tourism in certain areas without significant efforts to reduce environmental impact.\n\n\nIndigenous Communities\nDespite formal land tenure rights in some regions, weak enforcement leaves Indigenous communities vulnerable to land grabbing and resource exploitation. Social inequalities persist, limiting access to basic services and economic opportunities. While the importance of Indigenous knowledge is acknowledged in some policy frameworks, it remains marginalised in decision-making, reducing its influence on conservation and development (6). A lack of political will to strengthen land rights and governance structures further excludes Indigenous communities from shaping policies that impact their territories and livelihoods (7).\n\n\nGovernance, Planning and Resource Management\nWeak institutional coordination across governance levels and sectors continues to hinder the development of cohesive policies (8). Public participation is limited to token consultations, and decision-making processes lack transparency (9). Despite this, the trend of political stability does marginally improve public trust in the state.\nOverall Land use planning is improved, with every department completing Ecological and Economic Zoning plans (10). However, planning remains largely reactive and subject to capture by economic actors, meaning that developments are sometimes allowed to proceed in ecologically sensitive areas in contradiction of the zoning plans. This is especially true of urban expansion, which still occurs informally due to migration to areas of increasing economic activity and because of climatic change induced impacts.\nThe 2023 modification to the forest law is not repealed and forestry policy remains focused on short-term economic gains2. Existing forest concessions prioritize timber production although there is an increase in the number and scale of forest-based carbon credit projects which contribute towards reducing deforestation (11). However, because of the overall orientation of the sector alongside weak enforcement of regulations, the conversion of forest to agricultural land by small scale farmers is allowed to persist. This in addition to the granting of mining concessions on forested lands leads to a trend of continued forest cover loss and degradation until 2060.\n2 https://forestpolicy.org/risk-tool/country/peru#:~:text=In%20late%202023%2C%20the%20Peruvian,reconsideration%20from%20some%20Congress%20members3 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o17_20244 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o6_2024Transport infrastructure development focuses primarily on road improvement, enhancing connections and the quality of road networks without significant attention to minimizing ecological impacts. There is a particular expansion of export-related infrastructure (e.g. ports and processing facilities for agricultural and mining products) in key production sites such as the northern and southern coastal regions3. Communications infrastructure is improved however access to digital services remains uneven (12). To adapt to the increasing intensity and severity of natural disasters there is a strong focus on developing more resilient infrastructure4, although is achieved via improvements to engineering rather than the incorporation of Nature-Based Solutions.\nInadequate planning and management of water resources alongside global high intensity climate change (RCP 4.5 / RCP 6.0) exacerbate problems of water insecurity. Disruption to water availability and quality in mountainous regions driven by substantial further decline of glacial areas forces migration of the population to the coast. Given the increased demand for water for the agricultural sector there is a need to implement expensive technological solutions such as water desalination plants.\n\n\nEcological Restoration and Protection\nDue to a lack of political and social support there is no expansion of conservation areas beyond the existing coverage of 17.88% and hence Peru does not achieve its international commitment to protect 30% of the national territory by 2030. Programs to mitigate the trend of biodiversity loss are hindered by competing sectoral priorities and insufficient integration of long-term sustainability goals. Environmental restoration efforts are minimal and primarily driven by regulatory compliance. Degraded areas are often repurposed for monoculture plantations or urban expansion, exacerbating habitat loss and ecosystem degradation (13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Nature for Nature\n\nBy 2060, Peru’s landscapes are treated as vital, living entities deserving of protection not merely for their utility to humans but for their inherent worth. This transformation was sparked by a societal shift in the early 21st century, towards recognizing nature’s intrinsic value as a fundamental aspect of ethical living. This vision reshaped economic, social, and environmental governance priorities, aligning them with an ethos of coexistence and respect for life in all its forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\n  Climate Change:  RCP 2.6  \n\n\n  Population:  37.21 million \n\n\n  Economic development:  1007 billion USD  \n\n\n  Value perspective on nature:  Mainly Intrinsic \n\n\n  Protected areas (proportion of Peru under protection):  30% by 2030 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting Values and Lifestyles\nWitnessing first-hand the continued degradation of nature and the decline of characteristic species1 due to climate change and anthropogenic activities inspires a profound shift in societal values. Nature is no longer seen as a resource to be exploited but as a partner in a shared existence. This perspective is enshrined in law, building upon the legal precedent of the recognition of the Marañón river as an entity holding intrinsic rights, including the right to exist and the right to be free of pollution2. This concept of rights for nature is propagated through education initiatives to improve widespread environmental awareness among the population.\n1 https://news.mongabay.com/2018/11/extinction-by-omission-perus-disappearing-ancient-shihuahuaco-trees/)2 https://www.internationalrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2024/03/Maranon_Nota-de-Prensa-Local_19-Marzo-2024.pdf3 https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/02/plant-based-diet-biodiversity-report/#:~:text=Rearing%20crops%20in%20place%20of,be%20used%20for%20other%20purposesIn terms of lifestyles changes, the population adopts resource efficient behaviours to reduce the impact on nature. The share of the population living in urban areas reaches 92% by the year 2060 ((1), according to SSP1) with people opting to live in compact settlements that provide better access to services and amenities. There is also a substantial shift in diets towards more plant-based consumption to reduce pressure on ecosystems through livestock production3. The recognition of the intrinsic value of nature fosters wider societal inclusivity, which drives progress in reducing economic and social inequality, by, for example, addressing issues such as the disproportionate employment of women in the informal sector (2).\n\n\nChanging economic priorities\nEconomic development shifts towards sustainable activities in secondary urban centres beyond Lima, promoting local, eco-friendly businesses and reducing dependence on resource-intensive industries. This transition enhancing community resilience (3) and results in increased economic formalisation which generates revenue for greater governmental spending on nature protection as this is recognised as essential for the continuation and growth of the green economy4. Overall, there is moderate economic growth, with GDP per capita reaching approximately 1007 billion USD by 2060 (converted to USD using purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2017), as projected under SSP2 (4).\n4 https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/peru/2017-report/economy/in-the-open-a-new-strategy-is-in-place-to-help-more-workers-move-to-the-formal-sectorThe agricultural sector adopts techniques that emphasize harmony with nature such as agroforestry and agro-ecological farming (chacras agroecológicas integrales) (5,6). The organic agriculture sector expands with pesticides and synthetic fertilizers are replaced by natural alternatives, ensuring long-term productivity of the soil. However, these changes make agricultural production more extensive, requiring greater land area to meet food production demands. At the same time, the reduction in land utilised for livestock as a response to changing diets, does counteract this trend to an extent. To further reduce environmental impacts agricultural land is situated in closer proximity to urban areas to reduce length of the supply chain and hence minimize wastage.\nForestry policies are characterised by strict protection and restoration measures (7). Clearance of natural forests is heavily restricted, and production forests are required to shift towards native species over non-native high yield species. Similarly mining activities are strictly regulated, with no new concessions being granted beyond 2030, however existing operations are allowed to continue (8). However, due to stringent legal environmental requirements, only a limited portion of these concessions are exercised by the holders, minimizing the overall environmental impact. Tourism shifts towards nature-focused activities such as wildlife watching, forest and wetland walks, and marine conservation tours, actively promoting a more sustainable and respectful relationship with nature (9).\n\n\nIndigenous Communities\nThe wellbeing of Indigenous communities is improved through the strengthening of land rights, increased political representation, and participation in conservation efforts. In this regard, the role of Indigenous communities as environmental stewards is formally recognised in the expansion of protected areas with the inclusion of indigenously managed reserves (10). However, stricter land-use regulations do occasionally create tensions where communities seek to maintain traditional agricultural or resource use practices. In addition, there are targeted policies improve access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities (11).\n\n\nGovernance, Planning and Resource Management\nGovernance evolves to ensure transparency and effective regulation of activities impacting ecosystems, particularly the strict control of environmental pollution. The primary focus of landscape planning is minimising human impacts on nature. For example, when planning developments authorities must give equal consideration to the impacts on people and nature in accordance with the rights of both. In light of this, the 2023 modification to the Forest and Wildlife law5 is repealed and responsibility for forest zoning is returned to MINAM. Alongside this, the contracts of existing forest concessions are allowed to expire after their initial 40-year terms. Concession management is then aligned with a nature-first principle such that only operators demonstrating robust ecological stewardship have their concession contracts renewed. Non-renewed concession areas remain under state management and support sustainable activities like low-impact nature-focused tourism or community-led agroforestry.\n5 https://idehpucp.pucp.edu.pe/boletin-eventos/derechos-humanos-obligaciones-internacionales-y-deforestacion-de-la-amazonia-analisis-de-las-modificaciones-en-la-ley-forestal-y-de-fauna-silvestre-desde-el-derecho-internacional-29070/#_ftn13Urban areas throughout Peru are better planned for sustainability, with a trend towards overall densification whilst maintaining integrated green spaces. This ensures that there is less arbitrary sealing of natural surfaces (soil) in urban areas (12). The development of transport and communications infrastructure is mindful of the need to minimise ecological impact, with strategic road expansions that avoid sensitive areas to protect natural habitats and biodiversity. Better enforcement of the law prohibits illegal road construction in ecologically valuable areas (13).\nIn terms of water resources, the hydrographic network is carefully managed to ensure water courses follow natural dynamics. Initiatives aimed at using water more efficiently help to conserve the water needed for natural ecosystems to thrive (14), while governance frameworks enforce strict water conservation measures, preventing over-extraction and pollution of rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Water infrastructure development focuses on nature-based solutions, such as wetland restoration and watershed protection, to enhance water retention and quality (15). Strengthened regulatory oversight reduces illegal water diversion, while community-led water stewardship initiatives empower local actors to participate in sustainable resource management.\n\n\nEcological Restoration and Protection\nIn line with the notion of the need for areas for nature to thrive free from human impacts, there is a strong push to expand conservation areas to cover 30% of the national territory by 2030 with existing conservation areas and their management still persisting. Sites for new conservation areas are chosen on the basis of their value for preserving biodiversity whilst balancing the inclusion of Peru’s diverse eco-regions. These areas typically lie further from settlements to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. Therefore, they are often designated as government-managed strict protected areas (e.g. National Parks) where human activities inside core areas are strictly managed according to the IUCN category Ia or Ib6. However, a proportion of the new conservation areas are also established as indigenous-led biodiversity reserves with defined core and sustainable use areas. Environmental research within conservation areas is directed towards understanding how to maintain and restore biodiversity. In the wider landscape there are large-scale environmental restoration programs with the goal of restoring degraded areas to functioning natural habitats. Additionally, a large effort is made to limit the introduction of non-native species to safeguard endemic biodiversity (16).\n6 https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADas_de_%C3%A1reas_protegidas_de_la_UICN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This includes variation in genetic, phenotypic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes, as well as changes in abundance and distribution over time and space within and among species, biological communities and ecosystems.\n\nSource: Diaz et al., 2015\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem Services (ES)\n\n\n\nThe benefits people obtain from ecosystems. In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem services can be divided into supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural. This classification, however, is superseded in IPBES assessments by the system used under “Nature’s contributions to people”. This is because IPBES recognizes that many services fit into more than one of the four categories. For example, food is both a provisioning service and also, emphatically, a cultural service, in many cultures.\n\nSource: IPBES core glossary, 2021\n\n\n\nIUCN Category Ia\n\n\nCategory Ia areas are strictly protected to conserve biodiversity and geological features with minimal human impact. These reserves aim to preserve ecosystems in their natural state, free from modern human interference, serving as critical reference sites for scientific research and monitoring. Access is highly restricted to prevent disturbance, ensuring that ecological processes remain intact. Unlike wilderness areas (Ib), Ia areas are typically smaller and more rigorously controlled, excluding settlements and most human activities. They prioritize maintaining self-sustaining ecosystems without ongoing management, distinguishing them from Category IV or V areas that require active intervention.\n\nSource: IUCN Guidelines, 2013\n\n\n\nIUCN Category Ib\n\n\nCategory Ib protects vast, unmodified landscapes where natural processes dominate, and human influence is minimal. These areas retain their wild character, free from permanent infrastructure, and allow limited self-reliant visitation (e.g., hiking). Indigenous communities may practice low-impact traditional lifestyles. Unlike Category Ia, Ib areas are larger and tolerate some human presence, while differing from Category II by excluding mass tourism infrastructure. Their role includes conserving large-scale ecosystems, evolutionary processes, and providing solitude, making them vital for climate resilience and species migration.\n\nSource: IUCN Guidelines, 2013\n\n\n\nIUCN Category VI\n\n\nCategory VI conserves ecosystems through sustainable natural resource use, often in large, predominantly natural areas. Low-intensity, non-industrial activities (e.g., traditional fishing, agroforestry) are permitted if compatible with conservation. Unlike Category V’s cultural landscapes, VI areas prioritize biodiversity in near-natural settings while supporting local livelihoods. They may include zones of stricter protection (e.g., Ia cores) and are critical in regions where conservation depends on integrating human needs with ecological resilience.\n\nSource: IUCN Guidelines, 2013\n\n\n\nLand Use Land Cover (LULC)\n\n\n\nLand Use\n\nThe human use of a specific area for a certain purpose (such as residential, agriculture, recreation, industrial, etc.). Influenced by, but not synonymous with, land cover. Land-use change refers to a change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover.\n\n\nLand Cover\n\nThe physical coverage of land, usually expressed in terms\nof vegetation cover or lack of it. Related to, but not synonymous\nwith, land use.\n\nSource: Milenium Ecosystem Assessement, 2005\n\n\n\n\n\nModification of the Forest and Wildlife Law (Law No. 31973, 2023)\n\n\nIn late 2023, the Peruvian Congress approved Law No. 31973, which amends key provisions of the 2011 Forest and Wildlife Law. The modifications specifically alter Articles 29 and 33, suspending the mandate that forest zoning is required for granting enabling titles for permanent production forests. In addition, the law shifts the responsibility for approving forest zoning from the Ministry of the Environment (MINAM) to the Ministry of Agrarian Development and Irrigation (MIDAGRI). This change has generated strong opposition from Indigenous organizations, civil society, and environmental experts, who argue that it may lead to increased deforestation, undermine ecosystem functions and biodiversity, and disregard the rights of Indigenous peoples. Critics warn that the reform could not only promote impunity and weaken environmental governance, but also hinder Peru’s ability to meet its international climate change commitments. Notably, the law does not take effect automatically as it still requires additional regulations.\n\nSource: World Resources Institute, 2024\n\n\n\nNature’s Contribution to People (NCP)\n\n\n\nNature's contributions to people (NCP) are all the contributions, both positive and negative, of living nature (i.e. diversity of organisms, ecosystems, and their associated ecological and evolutionary processes) to the quality of life of people. Beneficial contributions from nature include such things as food provision, water purification, flood control, and artistic inspiration, whereas detrimental contributions include disease transmission and predation that damages people or their assets. Many NCP may be perceived as benefits or detriments depending on the cultural, temporal or spatial context.\n\nSource: Pörtner et al., 2021\n\n\n\nNature Futures Framework (NFF)\n\n\n\nA heuristic that captures diverse, positive values of human-nature relationships along three types of specific value perspectives on nature: intrinsic (also known as ‘nature for nature’), instrumental (‘nature for society’), and relational (‘nature as culture/one with nature’) values. These values of nature are not mutually exclusive and intricately intertwined by nature. In the context of Western science, these positive values can be located in a triangular space whose tips represent the three types of value perspectives on nature.\n\nSource: IPBES, 2023\n\n\n\nNormative Scenarios\n\n\n\nTarget-seeking scenarios (also known as “goal-seeking scenarios” or “normative scenarios”) are scenarios that start with the definition of a clear objective, or a set of objectives, specified either in terms of achievable targets, or as an objective function to be optimized, and then identify different pathways to achieving this outcome (e.g. through backcasting).\n\nSource: IPBES core glossary, 2021\n\n\n\nREDD+ Project\n\n\nREDD+ (short for “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation”) is an international climate initiative designed to curb forest-based greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries. It offers incentives—often through carbon markets or other payment schemes—to protect or sustainably manage forests, rather than cutting them down. By doing so, REDD+ can help maintain biodiversity, since preserving a wide range of species and ecosystems typically goes hand in hand with keeping forests intact. However, as actors in Peru’s REDD+ process have noted, simply focusing on carbon storage won’t guarantee healthy habitats if social, economic, and governance issues aren’t addressed. For instance, unclear land rights can spark conflicts, and local communities may not see fair benefits unless safeguards are in place. When well designed, though, REDD+ can channel funds into conservation areas, bolster sustainable livelihoods, and foster cooperation among government agencies, indigenous peoples, NGOs, and private companies. Done right, it’s a chance to tackle both climate change and biodiversity loss together.\n\nSource: Entenmann & Schmitt, 2013\n\n\n\nScenarios\n\n\n\nRepresentations of possible futures for one or more components of a system, particularly for drivers of change in nature and nature’s benefits, including alternative policy or management options.\n\nSource: IPBES, 2018"

    "text": "Nature for Society\n\nThe landscape of Peru in 2060 has been optimised to maintain the provision of key ecosystem services for society (1). This is achieved through strong cross-sectoral planning and a sustainability transformation driven by the adoption of green technologies and the mainstreaming of the economic valorisation of ecosystem services and biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\n  Climate Change:  RCP 2.6  \n\n\n  Population:  37.21 million \n\n\n  Economic development:  1192 billion USD \n\n\n  Value perspective on nature:  Mainly Instrumental \n\n\n  Protected areas (proportion of Peru under protection):  30% by 2030 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting Values and Lifestyles\nThe societal shift that enables the transformation of the landscape is rising GDP levels, leading to increased environmental awareness (2). Improved economic conditions allow communities to invest more in sustainable practices and environmental education. This reinforces the recognition of nature’s critical role in supplying vital ecosystem services, fostering a broader sense of environmental stewardship in the population. Through this impetus, the concept of ecosystem services is integrated in the economy, governance and planning (3).\nIn terms of lifestyle changes, there is a limited reduction in levels of personal consumption, for example reduced meat consumption, however prevailing ideas around what constitutes a high standard of living remain and the prevalence of resource efficiency improving technologies means that this is not a strong focus. Accordingly, economic growth is high, with GDP per capita reaching approximately 1192 billion USD by 2060 (converted to USD using purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2017) (4). Per capita living space is relatively large, and the trend of rural-urban migration continues such that ~92% of the population live in Urban areas by the year 2060 ((5): aligned with SSP1). Both of these factors that the contribute to a high level of total expansion in land utilized for human habitation.\n\n\nChanging economic priorities\nThe economy transitions towards greater sustainability and diversification as the reliance on extractive industries is reduced and service-based sectors expand. One example of this is the expansion of the Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES or MERESE) sector. Learning the lessons from the implementation of PES schemes in water management, there is an expansion of schemes to conserve agrobiodiversity, as well the implementation of a high-integrity carbon market12.\n1 https://www.gob.pe/institucion/minam/noticias/1058841-cop-29-peru-impulsa-mercados-de-carbono-que-aseguren-la-conservacion-ambiental-y-el-desarrollo-sostenible2 https://vcmintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VCMI-Consultation-Report_Espanol-1.pdf3 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o22_2024The growth of the service-sector is decentralized, with large cities other than Lima, becoming more pronounced regional economic hubs3. This perpetuates the existing trend of rural-urban migration although disparities between Lima and other regional hubs are reduced. The development of the service sector leads to increasing formalisation of economic activities with some tax revenues directed to improving the capacity of institutions to engage in proactive environmental planning (6).\nAcross all of the primary economic sectors there is an attempt to balance the goal of increased production whilst simultaneously improving sustainability (7). The principle means of achieving this is through strong regulatory frameworks and ‘green’ technological solutions to improve efficiency, including the uptake of circular economic principles4.\n4 https://capacity4dev.europa.eu/library/perus-path-towards-circular-economy_en?refpage=search#:~:text=Peru%20has%20made%20significant%20efforts,the%20competitiveness%20of%20productive%20sectors.5 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o45_20246 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o19_2024For example, in agriculture, digital technologies, such as automation, remote sensing and artificial intelligence driven data analysis are used optimize production5. The development of these technologies is fast-tracked through the creation of ecological industrial parks6 with the knowledge disseminated to farmers by existing producer cooperatives, who receive state support to provide training. These measures are also employed to reduce in food wastage across the production and supply chain (8). The use of composted biowaste from cities for fertilizer is a prime example of a successful circular economic measure. Similar efficiency gains are observed in livestock farming, however there is a reduction in overall production. This is partly due to a shift in the general population towards more plant-based diets but also the expansion of environmentally certified aquaculture (9) as an efficient means to produce dietary protein. A small artisanal fishing sector persists but this is not promoted above more efficient industrial fishing, which itself is subject to stricter quotas and technological advances to improve sustainability. By applying modern techniques and optimising resources, moderate intensification is achieved, meaning that agricultural and livestock production require less overall land whilst delivering improved food security.\nIn the mining sector the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is brought into law7. This makes companies responsible for the environmental impacts of their activities across their entire life cycle including the disposal and recovery of products and waste. This creates the incentive to introduce more circular practices such as the valorisation of mining waste, for example for use within the construction sector, as well eliminating the use of toxic chemicals such as cyanide. Additional mining concessions are granted, though these are limited to areas with comparatively lower values for ecosystem services and biodiversity. At the same time regulatory requirements remain flexible enough to sustain the viability of these operations, resulting in a steady rate of new site development.\n7 https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/47895-la-economia-circular-la-mineria-peruana8 https://forestpolicy.org/risk-tool/country/peru#:~:text=In%20late%202023%2C%20the%20Peruvian,reconsideration%20from%20some%20Congress%20members.9 https://fsc.org/en/fsc-standards10 https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-reddIn the forestry sector, the 2023 modification to the Forest and Wildlife law8 is repealed and responsibility for forest zoning is returned to MINAM. Forest concessions are supported to achieve certification under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards, ensuring sustainable environmental and social practices9. The expansion of carbon markets means that some concessions transition from logging to REDD+ projects10. The tourism sector remains largely focused on nature-based activities, such as wellness retreats and eco-friendly adventure sports, albeit with additional regulations ensuring that a proportion of revenue is used for environmental conservation.\n\n\nIndigenous Communities\nIndigenous communities are recognised as key actors in conservation, with community-driven conservation initiatives, underpinned by Indigenous knowledge, playing a central role in maintaining ecosystem services and addressing land-use conflicts (10). While the role of Indigenous communities in decision-making processes is strengthened, challenges remain in ensuring full inclusion, as external actors continue to influence key decisions. Land tenure security is enhanced, and benefit-sharing mechanisms are more widely implemented, although inconsistencies still exist, leading to regional disparities (11). Some land rights disputes continue to persist, necessitating ongoing dialogue to balance Indigenous autonomy with broader environmental and economic goals.\n\n\nGovernance, Planning and Resource Management\nThe systems of governance surrounding land and natural resources are made more robust, with effective monitoring and enforcement ensuring sustainable practices across sectors. This is guided by an environmental research agenda focusing on identifying solutions to optimize the provision of ecosystem services (12). This along with increased transparency of environmental regulations improves public trust. To ensure efficient and coherent planning, governance continues to be conducted in a largely top-down fashion, but with some decisions devolved to regional experts.\nThe overarching goal of landscape planning is to maximise the efficiency of land use by clustering similar activities together (residential areas, agriculture, etc.) and encouraging the multi-functional use of land (for example, renewable energy infrastructure integrated within agricultural areas). In line with this the provision of ecosystem services is directly considered within planning and incorporated within the Ecological and Economic Zoning plans which gain more prominence given the trend of regionalized economic development (13). In urban areas, Nature Based Solutions such as rain gardens and green roofs are used to limit the impact of flooding and heat exposure while simultaneously improving mental health by reinforcing the societal connection with nature11.\n11 https://www.wwf.org.pe/?373791/Soluciones-basadas-en-la-naturaleza-la-respuesta-a-muchos-de-los-desafios-globales12 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o4_202413 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o5_2024Improvements to infrastructure further bridge socio-economic divides by increasing access to basic services (14). Roads and public transport systems are upgraded with a focus of promoting greener, more efficient modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, to minimise environmental impacts12. Energy demand is increasingly met with renewable energy due to an expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. The management of water resources is improved with availability managed with a strong regulatory system, the expansion of existing tariff-based PES schemes, and technological innovations to improve efficiency of usage (15). Water quality is also enhanced through the implementation of modern bio-remediation methods13.\n\n\nEcological Restoration and Protection\nAs part of the effort to mitigate the impacts of climate change, large-scale environmental restoration projects are initiated to rehabilitate degraded areas, with a particular focus on soil restoration. In addition to boosting carbon sequestration and reducing local populations’ exposure to natural hazards, these projects create semi-natural habitats that support a variety of species, which in turn help maintain key ecosystem services and strengthen resilience. In accordance with the KM-GBF target14, the areal coverage of protected areas is expanded to 30% by the year 2030. New conservations areas are selected to prioritise the provision of key ecosystem services such as water maintenance and carbon sequestration, as well as their potential to improve the connectivity of the national conservation estate (16). These new conservation areas are managed according to IUCN category VI15, but may have different levels of management, such as national, regional, or private conservation areas, depending on the scale of the ecosystem services in question. This flexibility ensures that local communities can directly manage areas where benefits are largely local, while regions of broader territorial importance remain under the responsibility of regional or national authorities. Existing conservation areas retain their current governance and management arrangements.\n14 https://www.cbd.int/gbf15 https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADas_de_%C3%A1reas_protegidas_de_la_UICN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Nature as Culture\n\nPeru’s landscape in 2060 embodies a commitment to sustainability, cultural preservation, and social equity achieved through community-driven approaches. The principles of ‘Buen Vivir’ guide both economic activities and environmental governance, ensuring that nature and communities thrive in harmony. The country’s diverse eco-regions and characteristic landscapes are not only preserved but celebrated as integral components of national identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\n  Climate Change:  RCP 2.6  \n\n\n  Population:  37.21 million \n\n\n  Economic development:  812 billion USD \n\n\n  Value perspective on nature:  Mainly Relational \n\n\n  Protected areas (proportion of Peru under protection):  30% by 2030 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShifting in Values and Lifestyles\nIn response to the cultural homogenisation and disconnection from nature resulting from trends of neoliberal globalisation, the philosophy of Buen vivir gains mainstream appeal within Peruvian society(1–3). The central tenets of Buen vivir being a focus on wellbeing, sufficiency, collectivism and the harmonious relationship between people and nature (4). This prompts a revived societal recognition of the cultural and spiritual importance of Peru’s landscapes, driving broader economic and political change in the management of the environment and natural resources.\nFollowing the desire of the population to dwell closer to nature the increase in the proportion of the population living in urban areas is relatively small increasing from 78% to 81.5% by 2060 ((5), according to SSP3), resulting in a greater area of lower density settlements. At the same time in line with the spirit of self-sufficiency, individuals make efforts to reduce their consumption and generally live more sustainable lifestyles.\n\n\nChanging economic priorities\nThe current prevailing conception of economic development is redefined in accordance with the principles of Buen Vivir, resulting in a paradigm shift towards sustainable activities, particularly those incorporating traditional and indigenous knowledge, being prioritized over the maximisation of production. This results in GDP per capita, increasing to 812 billion USD by 2060 (converted to USD using purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2017), as projected under SSP3 (6).\nIn terms of agriculture, holistic agro-ecological techniques such as agroforestry become widespread and the cultivation of botanical and medicinal plants endemic to Peru is actively promoted, fostering both biodiversity and traditional knowledge preservation. This is achieved through actions such as the continued development of regional strategic, and action, plans on Biotrade, leading to the expansion of the national markets for these goods1. In addition, producer organizations play a key role in supporting local farmers and ensuring fair market access. As a result of these trends, there is a moderate expansion of the total area utilized for agriculture. Albeit with the intensity of agricultural activities remaining fairly low, reflecting a strong commitment to cultural values and ecological stewardship. Similarly, the sustainable artisanal fishing sector is promoted and safeguarded, supporting coastal communities.\n1 https://www.cifor-icraf.org/knowledge/publication/7881/Extractive activities such as mining activities, are allowed to continue, however they are now strictly regulated to minimize their ecological footprint. New concessions can be granted, but strict legal requirements keep the actual exploitation of these sites relatively low. Tourism shifts towards nature-based activities that connect visitors with Peruvian culture, such as farmer cooperative visits and traditional craft workshops. This not only supports local economies but reinforces the appreciation of landscapes and traditions. These changes in the economy result in a greater formalising of economic activities, with the subsequent tax revenues re-invested in improving local economies.\n\n\nIndigenous Communities\nIndigenous communities experience strengthened autonomy and cultural resurgence, guided by the principles of Buen Vivir. Traditional ecological knowledge is integrated into governance and economic activities, ensuring sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. Land tenure security is reinforced through an increase in the granting of outstanding applications for Indigenous land titles until 2060. These titled area are designated as Other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) with management responsibility devolved to communities. Community-led water management systems, inspired by ancestral techniques, enhance resilience to climate change (7).\n\n\nGovernance, Planning and Resource Management\nIn the political sphere, the governance of land and natural resources is strengthened through greater devolution of responsibilities to departmental authorities. In addition, there is greater citizen participation in decision-making using multi-stakeholder forums at the national and regional scales, building upon existing successes2, as well as incorporating digital innovations (CivicTech)3. These processes lead to increased transparency of environmental regulations promoting accountability and public trust in the state. The overarching orientation of landscape management is to prioritize equitable access to, and use of, land to ensure the material needs of the population are met whilst minimising environmental degradation. This is achieved through effective implementation of the ecological and economic zoning plans as well as the strict control of environmental pollution. The 2023 modification to the Forest and Wildlife law4 is repealed and responsibility for forest zoning is returned to MINAM. The design of policies is supported by an expanded environmental research agenda that seeks to integrate traditional ecological knowledge to foster holistic solutions for sustainability (8).\n2 https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/99094d14-e0b8-4c76-9c88-2dcd6cef2442/content3 https://observatorio.ceplan.gob.pe/ficha/o27_20244 https://idehpucp.pucp.edu.pe/boletin-eventos/derechos-humanos-obligaciones-internacionales-y-deforestacion-de-la-amazonia-analisis-de-las-modificaciones-en-la-ley-forestal-y-de-fauna-silvestre-desde-el-derecho-internacional-29070/#_ftn13Rural, and particularly indigenous communities, benefit from secure land tenure through formal titling, empowering them to actively participate in sustainable land management practices (9). Whereas urban areas are better planned to integrate green spaces and energy-efficient technologies. The steady implementation of infrastructure projects across the country, particularly communications infrastructure, has significantly reduced socio-economic inequality improving access to education, healthcare, and other basic services (10). The transport network specifically is developed to help supporting nature-based tourism without disturbing the integrity of the landscape.\nThe management of water resources sees remarkable improvements through devolved community-led systems utilising ancient water technologies (11,12). Semi-natural reservoirs and channels are revitalized, securing water availability and bio-remediation methods lead to improved water quality across urban and rural areas.\n\n\nEcological Restoration and Protection\nPeru achieves its obligations with regard to the KM-GBF target5 to expand the coverage of protected areas and Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs)6 to 30% of the countries territory by 2030. New OECMs are selected to specifically preserve landscapes characteristic of Peru, with a focus on balancing the representation of diverse eco-regions and sites of cultural heritage. To foster local stewardship, these OECMs are often designated on Indigenous community lands, where management is devolved to communities7.\n5 https://www.cbd.int/gbf6 https://iucn.org/news/202409/oecms-collaborative-agenda-2025-2030-towards-achieving-target-3-global-biodiversity7 https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADas_de_%C3%A1reas_protegidas_de_la_UICNWithin national protected areas , management focuses on reversing biodiversity loss, especially the protection of culturally significant species, as well as the mitigation of human and wildlife conflict. In tandem with the establishment of new conservation areas, large-scale environmental restoration projects have successfully revived degraded lands, enabling traditional practices such as the harvesting of non-timber forest products to flourish once again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Yesterday we held the 4th of our regional scenario creation workshops in the city of Huaraz, capital of the Ancash region. Situated in the Callejón de Huaylas valley at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, we choose Huaraz in order to bring a perspective on what might be desirable future changes in mountainous landscapes in Peru.\nPrior to the workshop, we explored the region for several days and saw first-hand the extent to which the Glaciers are already disappearing. At the same time we also saw some inspiring examples of how agricultural producers can take advantage of climatic conditions in the mountain valleys to produce an expansive range of crops.\nAs you can see from the photo below we had a full house with participants of different ages and backgrounds, from students and farmers, to mountain guides and members of the regional government. As in the other regional workshops, we used the 3 horizons frameworks to guide participants in thinking from the present landscape into the future and at the end of the session we received some thought-provoking inputs. Particularly that the workshop had been a good format to bring different actors together and that it was important to establish a means of communication for participants to continue the dialogue around driving positive change in the region in the future.\nOur last workshop of 2024 will be held in Tarapoto in the San Martín region on June 11th.\nHere are some photos from the workshop and below you can access the presentation that was shown."

However it was interesting to see that some characteristics, especially actions to promote positive change were similar.\nWe had planned to use several whiteboards to collect all the inputs for the 3 Horizons but we quickly realised that we had so many suggestions that we had to resort to use the wall and parts of the windows instead! This is testament to the energy and enthusiasm from our brilliant participants and we would like to thank them all again for their time.\nThis workshop could not have happened without the support from our partner organisation the Wyss Academy for Natures’ South American Hub, who kindly hosted us at their office. We would especially like to thank Liselot Lange, Alejandro Portillo and Armando Valdés-Velásquez for all their help with the organisation.\nToday we travel to the Ancash region to prepare for the next workshop in Huaraz on June 4th.\nHere are some photos from the workshop and below you can access the presentation that was shown."
