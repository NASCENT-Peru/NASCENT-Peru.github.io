The scenarios will be developed through an inclusive participatory process with a cross-section of Peruvian stakeholders, employing the IPBES Nature Futures Framework (NFF) to encourage a shift beyond typical exploratory trends such as ‘Business as Usual’ to envisage future landscapes that meet the needs of society, support cultural values and preserve nature. Building upon the approach of the ValPar.CH project, quantitative simulation modelling along with economic analysis will be leveraged to identify trade-offs and synergies in BES outcomes, to inform an ongoing dialogue regarding the desirability and feasibility of the different scenario goals."

This is because IPBES recognizes that many services fit into more than one of the four categories. For example, food is both a provisioning service and also, emphatically, a cultural service, in many cultures.\n\nSource: IPBES core glossary, 2021"
