		<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

		<section class="auto" name="a">
			<p class="lead"><b>Nature for Nature</b> emphasizes the protection and promotion of biodiversity. This
				scenario
				characterizes that in certain areas for biodiversity promotion, humans are denied access. There is a
				societal consensus that biodiversity needs its space to thrive, as people value nature for its intrinsic
				values.</p>
			<p class="copy">This scenario assumes that human society globally follows sustainable pathways (SSP1) and
				climate action is effective (RCP 2.6). The Swiss population grows slightly to reach 9.5 million in 2060
				and the economy strives for a system beyond growth. The principle of sufficiency applies to both
				generation and consumption, resulting in a sharp drop in energy demand compared to 2020. Energy supply
				is relying on highly efficient renewable energy plants in a few locations. Recreational areas near urban
				and peri-urban areas are managed to avoid disturbing biodiversity hotspots (e.g., by closing river or
				forest areas), while existing tourism areas (e.g., ski resorts) are transformed into sustainably managed
				ecotourism areas (e.g., opportunities for guided wildlife viewing). While settlements in remote rural
				areas are abandoned, small towns in mountain areas are preserved with spatial constraints on urban
				development. Nationwide, there is no further urban sprawl compared to today. Both agricultural and
				forestry policies focus on promoting biodiversity. Soil-independent production using hydroponic farming
				methods takes place in industrial areas, while soil-dependent agriculture in rural areas is strongly
				connected to biodiversity measures: direct agricultural payments are linked to landscape quality and
				ecological connectivity, as are subsidies for land set aside for the development of habitats for
				sensitive species. EI has high priority on the political agenda and is coordinated among sectors with a
				strong focus on promoting biodiversity. An EI sectoral plan defines the EI through spatial planning and
				cantons are actively promoting EI planning and implementation while coordinating with the federal level.
				Protected areas will be expanded to cover 30% of Switzerland's land area by 2060, and their management
				will be site-specific according to IUCN categories Ia or IV. Species and habitats important for
				biodiversity, ecosystem processes and functions will be prioritized in the selection of new protected
				area sites. </p>
		</section>
		<section class="auto" name="b">
			<p class="lead"><b>Nature as Culture</b> sets the priority on integrating communities into land management.
				It assumes
				a multifunctional land management with strong focus on community engagement and regional development.
				Biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people are highly respected, and the development of a
				regional EI is ingrained in human culture. </p>
			<p class="copy">This scenario assumes that humanity follows sustainable pathways (SSP1) and climate forcing
				is very limited (RCP2.6). In 2060, the Swiss population will have grown slightly to 9.5 million, and the
				Swiss economy will have shifted towards a regionalized model beyond growth with short market chains.
				Compared to 2020, there is a slight decrease in energy demand. Energy supply is decentralized, with
				greater efficiency and savings sought at local and regional levels. Recreational areas near urban and
				peri-urban areas are managed to avoid disturbing biodiversity hotspots (e.g., by closing river or forest
				areas), while existing tourism areas (e.g., ski resorts) are transformed into sustainably managed
				ecotourism areas that convey regional values (e.g., opportunities to participate in agricultural
				projects). In mountain areas, villages continue to exist, and in general more people will move to rural
				settlements surrounded by extensively managed agricultural areas. However, nationwide urban sprawl is
				limited to current levels. Agricultural policy focuses on promoting both biodiversity and community
				engagement: direct payments are linked to landscape quality and ecological connectivity, as are
				subsidies for further subsidies for involving local communities in the land management. EI has high
				priority on the political agenda and is coordinated among sectors to promote biodiversity and immaterial
				NCPs. An EI sectoral plan defines the EI through spatial planning and cantons are actively promoting EI
				planning and implementation while coordinating with the federal level. By 2060, protected areas will be
				expanded to cover 25% of Switzerland's land area, and their management will be site-specific according
				to IUCN categories V or VI. Species and landscape elements that are important for local communities and
				cultural heritage are given priority when selecting sites for new protected areas.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="auto" name="c">
			<p class="lead"><b>Nature for Society</b> focuses on the sustainable supply of NCPs to the Swiss
				population. It assumes
				a strong division of the landscape: Housing, agricultural production, biodiversity protection,
				recreation, energy production are spatially separated. This has implications for the planning of rural
				and urban areas, with most people living in large, green cities. Society highly values NCPs for their
				instrumental values, i.e. the provision of material (e.g., timber, crops), regulatory (e.g., flood
				control), and immaterial (e.g., recreation) assets. </p>
			<p class="copy">Global development on a mid-range climate warming path (RCP4.5) and socio-economic
				development at business-as-usual (SSP2) form the basic assumptions of this scenario. In Switzerland, the
				population grows to 10.5 million people and the economy is characterized by green growth and efficient
				technological innovations. Urban and peri-urban areas are growing rapidly. Small towns with spatial
				restrictions on settlement development are emerging in mountainous areas, while settlements in remote
				rural areas are increasingly being abandoned. Overall, the extent of urban sprawl remains at current
				levels. Energy demand increases slightly compared to 2020 and is met by high-efficiency renewable energy
				facilities in designated areas. Recreational areas near urban and peri-urban areas are selected to be
				highly attractive (e.g., forests for mountain biking, lakes for water sports), while existing tourism
				areas (e.g., high-altitude ski resorts) are sustainably strengthened and new ecotourism areas are
				established. Agricultural policy focuses on promoting production on the most suitable soils through
				yield-based direct payments and further subsidies for the acquisition of new technologies. Forestry
				policy increasingly focuses on the recreational function of forests, while maintaining their other
				functions. EI has high priority on the political agenda and is coordinated among sectors to provide a
				diversity of NCPs. An EI sectoral plan defines the EI through spatial planning and cantons are actively
				promoting EI planning and implementation while coordinating with the federal level. By 2060, protected
				areas will be expanded to cover 17% of Switzerland's land area, with site selection focused on
				ecosystems important to biodiversity and Switzerland's NCP needs, and site-specific management according
				to IUCN categories II or IV. </p>
		</section>
		<section class="auto" name="d">
			<p class="lead"><b>Business as usual</b> assumes the continuing trends of the last decades: The broader
				society
				continues to have a distorted view of the biodiversity crisis lacking comprehension of its reality in
				Switzerland. Since EI is not an issue in Swiss society, people follow their current value patterns by
				valuing nature for providing NCPs but without understanding the underlying social-ecological feedbacks.
			</p>
			<p class="copy">The scenario assumes a mid-range climate warming path (RCP4.5) and socio-economic
				development at business-as-usual (SSP2). In Switzerland, the population grows to 10.5 million people and
				the economy is characterized by green growth. Agricultural policy focuses on promoting production with
				integrated biodiversity measures through direct payments linked to landscape quality and ecological
				connectivity. Recreational areas near urban and peri-urban areas are selected to ensure high
				attractiveness (e.g., forests for mountain biking, lakes for water sports activities), while existing
				tourism areas (e.g., high-altitude ski resorts) continue to be supported to maximize their use. Urban
				and peri-urban areas are growing moderately, while more and more remote rural settlements are being
				abandoned. Overall, the extent of urban sprawl remains at current levels. Some cantons actively promote
				EI planning and implementation, but coordination with the federal level is poor. Until 2060, coverage of
				protected areas will remain the same as the present day. Protected area management will proceed under
				current strategies, i.e. mostly under IUCN categories II or IV.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="auto" name="e">
			<p class="lead"><b>Uncontrolled Growth</b> follows trends of drivers identified as hindering for EI
				development:
				There is a general mentality of disinterest in the biodiversity crisis and a lack of cross-sectoral and
				cross-cantonal cooperation, while at the same time agricultural practices that are detrimental to
				biodiversity are increasing and urban sprawl is growing. </p>
			<p class="copy">In the face of global crises, Switzerland is striving for domestic agricultural production
				to ensure food security for the population. Globally, SSP3 and RCP8.5 are assumed, leading to
				significantly warmer conditions and more frequent extreme events in Switzerland than in any of the other
				four scenarios. Urban and peri-urban areas are growing moderately, with industrial areas developing in
				an uncoordinated manner. In rural areas, building is increasingly taking place outside the construction
				zone. Energy demand has increased sharply compared to 2020 in the absence of an overarching spatial
				strategy for energy supply. Recreation areas near urban and peri-urban areas are selected in a way that
				ensure close attractivities (e.g., forests for mountain biking, lakes for water sport activities) while
				existing tourism areas (e.g., high-altitude ski resorts) are continued to be supported to maximize their
				use. Agricultural policy strongly promotes production, with direct payments linked to yield numbers,
				while forestry policy focuses on timber production and hazard protection. EI is not on the political
				agenda of the federal government, which means that EI is not planned at all nationwide, let alone
				implemented. In 2060, some of the protected areas that exist today will continue to be managed under
				IUCN Category II, while others will exist only on maps.</p>

				<h3>Welcome to our interactive platform presenting land use and land cover change simulations under
					different scenarios framing the development of Ecological Infrastructure (EI) until 2060 in
					Switzerland.</h3>
				<p>
					Through a participatory process involving stakeholders and experts, we co-designed five integrated,
					multi-scale scenarios framing the development of Ecological Infrastructure (EI) until 2060 in
					Switzerland. We developed three normative scenarios (EI for nature, EI for society, EI as culture)
					that aim at encapsulating desirable visions for the landscape and the EI by the year 2060, alongside
					two exploratory scenarios tracking current trends (Business as usual) and hindering trends for EI
					(Growth and extinction), respectively. For more information on the participatory development of the
					scenarios, see this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-023-01380-7"
						target="_blank">article</a> published on this topic.
				</p>


				<p>In a second phase, we operationalized these scenarios into quantitative inputs for a land use-land
					cover (LULC) change model using a combination of existing projections of future drivers (e.g. the
					Swiss population and economic growth scenarios, as well as climate change predictions) as well as
					routines to affect changes in spatial trends based on the scenario assumptions. The detailed
					methodology is the subject of an upcoming article.</p>
				<p>When viewed at the extent of the total land area of Switzerland, the changes between 2020 and 2060
					under each scenario may appear minimal and difficult to observe. For this reason, we have supplied
					several visualisations of the results which we would like to briefly explain below.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>The five scenarios are presented in a tabular view, with the columns corresponding to the separate
					scenarios and the rows contain different types of information and results. You can either stay in
					the general overview of all 5 scenarios, click on a single column to enlarge the respective
					scenario, or click on a second column to focus on two scenarios simultaneously. If you click again
					in the green header, you will return to the general overview of all five scenarios.</p>

				<p>In the first row we briefly summarize the narrative of the scenario with the subsequent row below
					highlighting some key characteristics (e.g. correspondence to global climate change scenarios). If
					you click on the headings (underlined) of the individual characteristics, you will be provided with
					more information on the data and assumptions used.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>Below the information rows, we present a bar chart showing the percentage difference in the area of
					each LULC class in 2060 relative to 2020. If you swipe over the bars, more detailed information will
					be displayed. The LULC classes we have modelled are aggregate classes based on the 72 classes of the
					<a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/raum-umwelt/erhebungen/area.html"
						target="_blank">Swiss
						area
						statistics</a>, if you are interested on exact details of the aggregation scheme it is presented
					in this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815222002742"
						target="_blank">article</a>.
				</p>
				<p><img src="img/example-bar-chart.png"></p>
				<hr>
				<p>Below this, you have the option to interactively browse the maps of LULC for Switzerland in 2020
					(current data) and 2060 (simulated), feel free to pan and zoom to areas you are familiar with or are
					interested in.</p>
				<p>You can also press the "Change" button to the right which shows a map highlighting the differences
					between 2060 and 2020 by selecting individual LULC classes (red indicates a decrease in area, green
					an increase). Given that the expansion of Protected Areas (PAs) was a strong focus of the normative
					scenarios we have also included a map of the existing PAs in Switzerland (including Ramsar sites,
					the Swiss National Park, Unesco Biosphere Reserves, Unesco Cultural Sites, Unesco Natural Sites,
					ProNatura reserves, Emerald sites, cantonal PAs, biodiversity promotion areas of quality II) as well
					as the hypothetical new PAs that were implemented within the LULC change model as an influence on
					the spatial locations of change. These maps for 2060 differ under each normative scenario and can be
					viewed using the button “Protected”.</p>
				<p><img src="img/example-map.png"></p>
				<hr>
				<p>Notice how simultaneously with your click on a LULC class in the map, the Sankey diagram in the row
					below changes. In this diagram you can see the relative areas of each LULC class that transitioned
					into other classes between 2020 and 2060.Of course this obscures some intermediate conversions in
					the time steps in between, but it is nonetheless useful to give an overall view of the transitions
					between classes.</p>
